#Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. Parent class is the class 
#being inherited from, also called base class. Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

class A: #Super class
    def feature1(self):
        print("Feature 1 is working")

    def feature2(self):
        print("Feature 2 is working")


# Class B is inheriting all the features of class A
class B(A): #Class B is a child class of Class A, Subclass
    def feature3(self):
        print("Feature 3 is working")

    def feature4(self):
        print("Feature 4 is working")

class  C(B): #Child Class
    def feature5(self):
        print("Feature 5 is working")


a1 = A()

a1.feature1()
a1.feature2()

b1 = B()

b1.feature1() #now object of class B is able to access all the features of Class A

c1 = C()

c1.feature1() #A child can access parent, grandparent classes

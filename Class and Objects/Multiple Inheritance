#A class can be derived from more than one superclass in Python. This is called multiple inheritance
class A:
    def feature1(self):
        print("Feature 1 is working")

    def feature2(self):
        print("Feature 2 is working")

class B:
    def feature3(self):
        print("Feature 3 is working")

    def feature4(self):
        print("Feature 4 is working")

class C(A,B):
    def feature5(self):
        print("Feature 5 is working")

a1 = A()
b1 = B()
c1 = C()

a1.feature1() #can access only class A features
b1.feature4() #can access only class B features
c1.feature1() #We can observe c1 object of class C can access all the features from both Class A and B i.e is inheriting both a and b class

#12. Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers 
#from the original list. Use list comprehension to solve this problem.




#13.Write a Python function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) as input and returns its transpose. The transpose of a matrix switches the rows and columns. 
#For example, if the input matrix is [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], the output should be [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]].



#14.Write a Python function that takes two strings as input and returns True if they are anagrams and False otherwise. 
#Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams.

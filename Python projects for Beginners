2.Number Guessing , Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100,
or any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, 
and his score gets reduced. The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.

import random

comp = random.randint(0,10)

player = int(input("Guess number between 0 - 10: "))
while player != comp:
    if player < comp:
        print("Higher")
        player = int(input("Guess number between 0-10: "))
    
    elif player > comp:
        print("Lower")
        player = int(input("Guess number between 0-10"))

print("You got it")

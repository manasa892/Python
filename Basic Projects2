    "Name" : "Manasa",
    "Id" : "RED011",
    "Department" : "IT"
}

print(len(mydict),"is the length of the given dictionary.")


43.Write a program to iterate over the key-value pairs of a dictionary.

#If-Else Concepts
45.Write a program to check if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
n = int(input("Enter the digit: "))

if n > 0:
    print("The entered digit",n,"is positive.")
elif n < 0:
    print("The entered digit",n,"is negative.")
else:
    print("The entered digit",n,"is zero.")


46.Write a program to determine if a year is a leap year or not.
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if(year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 ) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(year, "is a leap year.")
else:
    print(year,"is not a leap year.")


47.Write a program to find the largest of three numbers.
n1 = int(input("Enter the first digit: "))
n2 = int(input("Enter the second digit: "))
n3 = int(input("Enter the third digit: "))

if n1>n2 and n1>n3:
    print(n1," is the largest number.")
elif n2>n1 and n2>n3:
    print(n2," is the largest number.")
else:
    print(n3," is the largest number.")

48.Write a program to determine if a given number is even or odd.
n = int(input("Enter the number: "))

if n % 2 == 0 :
    print("The number is even")
else:
    print("The number is odd")
    
    
49.Write a program to check if a given sentence is a palindrome. Ignore spaces, punctuation,
and capitalization while checking for a palindrome. Example: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" should be considered a palindrome
import re

sentence = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"

#Remove spaces and punctuation from the sentence
cleaned_sentence = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]','',sentence.lower())

#check if the cleaned sentence is equal to its reverse
if cleaned_sentence == cleaned_sentence[::-1]:
    print("The sentence is a palindrome.")
else:
    print("The sentence is not a palindrome.")
    

#While Loop
50.Write a program to print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
i = 0
while i < 10:
    i += 1
    print(i)
    
    
51.Write a program that continuously prompts the user to enter a number until they enter a negative number. Display the sum of all the positive numbers entered.


52.Write a program that prints all the even numbers from 1 to 20 using a while loop.
53.Write a program that asks the user to guess a secret number between 1 and 100. Keep prompting the user for guesses until they guess the correct number. Provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
54.Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.
